Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Software engineering is the step by step use of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. 
Its importance in the technology industry in this age can't be overemphasized as it's like the backbone of the modern day living from our phones used for communication to the vehicles 
for transportation. It is the source for the operating systems and various applications. So, without these field of engineering it's like going back to stone age.

For the milestones in sorfware en gineering, it started with the development of computer language in the 1950s, like Fortran in 1954.
Then next was the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
Another noteworthy milestone is the beginning structured program ming in 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
